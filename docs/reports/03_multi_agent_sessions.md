## AI Analysis

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Deploy: gpt-4.1-mini + default system prompt**

Achieves 100% pass rate at ~40% lower total cost than gpt-5-mini with comparable response quality and correct tool usage.

**Reasoning:**  
Both agents passed all tests (100% pass rate). gpt-4.1-mini completed the full multi‑turn session at **$0.001419 total cost**, compared to **$0.002354** for gpt-5-mini, a **~40% cost reduction**. Response quality and tool selection were equivalent across all turns, making cost the decisive factor.

**Alternatives:**  
- **gpt-5-mini**: Same pass rate and behavior, but ~66% higher cost for this test set. No quality advantage observed to justify the premium.

## 📦 Tool Response Optimization

### get_balance (from pytest_aitest.testing.banking_mcp)
- **Current response size:** ~20–25 tokens
- **Issues found:** Redundant fields (`balance` and `formatted`) where only the formatted value is used in responses.
- **Suggested optimization:** Return a single balance field optimized for display.
- **Estimated savings:** ~30–40% tokens per call

**Example current vs optimized:**
```json
// Current (~24 tokens)
{"account":"checking","balance":1500.0,"formatted":"$1,500.00"}

// Optimized (~14 tokens)
{"account":"checking","balance":"$1,500.00"}
```

### transfer (from pytest_aitest.testing.banking_mcp)
- **Current response size:** ~55–65 tokens
- **Issues found:** Multiple redundant fields (`amount` vs `amount_formatted`, verbose `message`) not required by the agent.
- **Suggested optimization:** Keep IDs and new balances only; let the agent generate phrasing.
- **Estimated savings:** ~40–45% tokens per call

**Example current vs optimized:**
```json
// Current (~60 tokens)
{
  "transaction_id":"TX0001",
  "type":"transfer",
  "from_account":"checking",
  "to_account":"savings",
  "amount":100,
  "amount_formatted":"$100.00",
  "new_balance_from":1400.0,
  "new_balance_to":3100.0,
  "message":"Successfully transferred $100.00 from checking to savings."
}

// Optimized (~32 tokens)
{
  "transaction_id":"TX0001",
  "from":"checking",
  "to":"savings",
  "new_balance_from":1400.0,
  "new_balance_to":3100.0
}
```

### get_all_balances (from pytest_aitest.testing.banking_mcp)
- **Current response size:** ~45–55 tokens
- **Issues found:** Nested structure and duplicate numeric vs formatted totals.
- **Suggested optimization:** Flatten balances and remove unused numeric totals.
- **Estimated savings:** ~35% tokens per call

**Example current vs optimized:**
```json
// Current (~50 tokens)
{
  "accounts":{
    "checking":{"balance":1500.0,"formatted":"$1,500.00"},
    "savings":{"balance":3000.0,"formatted":"$3,000.00"}
  },
  "total":4500.0,
  "total_formatted":"$4,500.00"
}

// Optimized (~32 tokens)
{
  "checking":"$1,500.00",
  "savings":"$3,000.00",
  "total":"$4,500.00"
}
```

## 💡 Optimizations

1. **Session state validation in tests** (recommended)
   - Current: After a transfer, `get_all_balances` returns the original balances (checking $1,500 / savings $3,000), not the post‑transfer values shown in the transfer response.
   - Change: Add an assertion that verifies balance consistency across turns within the same session.
   - Impact: Improves test correctness and prevents false positives; no cost increase, higher signal quality in failures.

2. **Prefer gpt-4.1-mini as default model** (recommended)
   - Current: Both models used interchangeably.
   - Change: Set gpt-4.1-mini as the default for this banking MCP test suite.
   - Impact: **~40% cost reduction** per session with no loss in pass rate or tool accuracy.
