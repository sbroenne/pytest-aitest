Higher humidity makes the air feel stickier and can make sun exposure feel hotter; Sydney will feel a bit drier and more comfortable for active play.\n\n- Wind and water conditions: Tokyo’s light easterly wind (8 km/h) will give calmer sea and less sand blowing — better for swimming, sunbathing, picnics and children. Sydney’s stronger southeast wind (20 km/h) will make beaches breezier, which can cause sand to blow and create choppier surf and stronger currents — better for surfing, wind/kite sports, but less comfortable for lounging on the sand.\n\nOverall recommendation:\n- If your idea of a “beach day” is relaxing, sunbathing and easy swimming, Tokyo is the better choice because of the gentler wind and calmer conditions.\n- If you want active water sports (surfing, kitesurfing) or don’t mind a breezy beach, Sydney is better because of the stronger wind and slightly warmer, drier air.\n\nPractical tips\n- For both: bring sunscreen (SPF 30+), water to stay hydrated, sunglasses and a hat.
