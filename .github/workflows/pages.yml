# Deploy documentation and demo report to GitHub Pages
#
# This workflow:
# 1. Builds MkDocs documentation
# 2. Copies the hero report demo to docs/demo/
# 3. Deploys everything to GitHub Pages
#
# The hero report (docs/demo/hero-report.html) must be generated
# manually before merging to main:
#   pytest tests/showcase/ -v --aitest-html=docs/demo/hero-report.html
